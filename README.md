# Go Learning Repository

A comprehensive guide to learning Go (Golang) from foundational concepts to advanced topics. This repository provides detailed explanations, practical examples, and hands-on exercises to master Go programming.

## 📚 Learning Path

### 1. **Getting Started**
- [Go Modules System](./01-getting-started/modules/) - Complete guide to Go modules, dependency management, and project structure
- [Basic Syntax](./01-getting-started/basic-syntax/) - Variables, constants, basic types, and operators
- [Control Flow](./01-getting-started/control-flow/) - If/else, loops, switch statements, and defer

### 2. **Core Concepts**
- [Functions](./02-core-concepts/functions/) - Function declarations, parameters, return values, and closures
- [Data Structures](./02-core-concepts/data-structures/) - Arrays, slices, maps, and structs
- [Pointers](./02-core-concepts/pointers/) - Understanding pointers, memory management, and references

### 3. **Object-Oriented Programming**
- [Structs](./03-oop/structs/) - Custom types, methods, and composition
- [Interfaces](./03-oop/interfaces/) - Interface definition, implementation, and polymorphism
- [Embedding](./03-oop/embedding/) - Struct embedding and interface embedding

### 4. **Advanced Topics**
- [Concurrency](./04-advanced/concurrency/) - Goroutines, channels, and synchronization
- [Error Handling](./04-advanced/error-handling/) - Error types, custom errors, and best practices
- [Packages](./04-advanced/packages/) - Creating, importing, and organizing packages

### 5. **Testing & Best Practices**
- [Testing](./05-testing/) - Unit tests, benchmarks, and test coverage
- [Best Practices](./06-best-practices/) - Code organization, naming conventions, and idiomatic Go

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Go 1.21+ installed
   ```bash
   go version
   ```

2. **Clone and explore**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo>
   cd go-learning
   ```

3. **Run examples**:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to any example directory
   cd 01-getting-started/basic-syntax
   
   # Run the example
   go run main.go
   ```
